# Parking Lot Schedules
Input files for parking lot schedules.

# Usage
Each line of parking lot schedule input file corresponds to the integer time in seconds that a car leaves the parking lot.

Examining the `parking_lot_schedule_02_two_cars.txt` input file,
we observe that a car leaves at 0 seconds, 1 second, and 2 seconds since the start of the simulation.

You can pass different input files to the system as arguments.
For example,

```
./bin/campus-evacuation parking_lot_schedule_00_no_cars.txt
```

# Origin Destination Data
Origin destination (OD) data for road intersections.

# Usage
OD data is represented as a CSV, 
where the columns represent the point of origin, 
the destination, 
and the flow rate from origin to destination.

Examining the `od_data_00_ab.csv` input file,
we observe that node A has traffic flow to node B with a flow rate of 100.
